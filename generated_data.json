We will provide her with additional training and mentorship to improve her focus and ensure she understands the importance of following procedures. It is also important to remember that she is new to the job and working hard to learn, she should not be made to feel as though she cannot ask questions when unsure. Further, she should understand that she can come to management with issues that she is struggling with, as opposed to discussing it with a colleague.
